# Virtual-robot-trajectory
Virtual robot trajectory can be achieved in Windows environment with OpenGL tools，and it will significantly reduce the costs of developing robot and optimize robot trajectories of the robot，which is the subject of the significance of topics。This paper briefly introduces the principle of the computer simulation system，its advantages，and its process； elaborated the significance of the study of the robot trajectory using computer simulation study of the meaning of the robot trajectory。Through the research of this article，a robot trajectory simulation system is developed based on VC++ and OpenGL。
